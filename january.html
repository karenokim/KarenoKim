  <p class="j1">January/2022</p>
 <p class="j2">Where I live the month of January is the time most deprived of sunlight. Having lived in New England for over three years, I have made subtle notices that occur to me during this month - I start to wear mostly monochromatic colors, spend much more time indoors, and struggle to find it way harder to get out of bed in the morning. But this year, I wanted to feel less absorbed by the dull weather. Starting on the first day of the month and the year, I decided to start a daily quilt project, utilizing the bojagi seam, to record my feelings and reconcile my emotions. This collection is a visual and tactile archive of the darkest month of the year. </p>
