    <h1> BEYOND BRAILLE </h1> 
    <h5> INCLUSIVE TYPOGRAPHY </h5>
    <hr/>
    <div>handmade / inclusive </div>
    <p>In this day and age, ‘inclusive’ is of paramount importance not only within but also beyond the design world. In fact, ‘gender-inclusive bathrooms’ are becoming to be more commonplace than ever. Although it seems like we have come this far in talking about and approaching design through the lens of inclusivity, which individuals are overlooked or unnoticed?
    <div>The tactile landscape of Braille </div>
    <div>The term typography comes from the Greek word ‘typos’, meaning form or impression, and ‘graphein’, meaning to write. So is braille a form of typography? Where does it stand in the realm of typography?</div>

<p>First, braille is embossed, not printed like most typography is. In the realm of typography, braille would be the tactile typography. Therefore, braille requires one to develop immense tactile sensitivity to properly decipher.</p>



How did tactile typography come to place?
The first tactile typeface was invented by Valentine Hauy. The concept of ‘touch reading’ was first introduced by print lettering embossed onto heavy paper. But just has any first inventions seem to have more limitations than successes, so was the case for the first tactile typeface. The raised letters were imprecise and inefficient, and on top of that, it was also extremely expensive to process such books composed only of embossed letters.  

Maybe add a timeline here for the history

Later in 1824, Louis Braille at the Royal Institute of the Young Blind, was influenced by the system of “night writing”, which was a system of writing used in the military. Louis narrowed down the 12-dot system to 6 dots to encourage a more efficient reading experience. The pattern of the raised dots could be sensed from a single touch.

But is Braille enough? 
are new systems needed? 
Fewer than 10% of the visually impaired can read braille, and yet braille is considered the standard for default 


HOW BRAILLE WORKS
Braille uses a simple grid of 6 dots to shape each letter. Because braille is always the same size, it is inevitably difficult for people with motor impairments or limited tactile sensitivity to read braille. In addition to that, braille is always the same scale. 
Imagine being confined to using only designing and reading in 12pt type




William Moon Light for the Blind, 1877
William Moon (1818-94) began experimenting with embossed writing systems soon after he lost his sight in 1840. This experimentation began with modifying the Roman alphabet to a system comprising nine characters. From there, he invented the ‘Moon’ alphabet. Moon sought to improve existing embossed reading systems, which were complex and difficult for people with calloused and insensitive hands. 

“A lad who had in vain for five years endeavoured to learn by the other systems, could in ten days read easy sentences” 

Kosuke Takahashi’s Braille Neue 
Kosuke Takahashi conducted research to see whether lareg scale signage, such as exit signs and toilet signs, with Braille Neue was readable for visually imparied people. He found that as long as there is a 6-dotted pattern, it is possible for them to read the signs regardless of its size. </p>

    <p>“Braille tends to be small and invisible, but with Braille Neue, it has the possibility to expand spatially into large signage in new ways” </p>
