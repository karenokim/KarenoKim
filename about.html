Her daily rituals include drinking tea, making her bed, and reading at midnight. Currently, she is mostly inspired by light. The light that was the first thing to be created in the book of Genesis, the light that wakes her up every morning, and the light that glistens the river she walks past everyday. Her work is a collection of her daily meditation of and appreciation for the light that surrounds, moves, and inspires her.</p>
